## [[therapy]]
### Recapping weekend in Seattle with [[Dr. DiSano]]
### If you're an open person, you're looser and experience more. It radiates out where people feel of that open energy. Subtle muscles and micro-expressions may have changed.
### You're working at building [[faith]] that you'll internally change. You go to church to [[develop]] faith. You go to therapy to develop faith in yourself.
### Your goal might be "how am I connected and desiring to be more connected" --> ultimately this leads to being more connected with yourself.
### Is it a beauty contest or are you understanding who they are and connecting? You want more.
### I got my vanity metrics down --> cut my hair, dress well, brush my teeth, workout. Here's the next level of you:
#### I'm concerned about my longevity and healthy.
#### I can are about the thoughts I have. What's important to me?
#### I care about fulfilling desires I can control.
### You didn't have the input. You didn't know better before. It's not like you knew and did it anyways.
### You've never had compassion for yourself. You only had expectations. You have high expectations that have gotten you far. You should feel blessed.
#### Find a different lens to transform your expectations
#### Psychedelics allow you to transform your energy and have a different perspective.
##### Drawbacks --> happens fast and you're using a tool.
